Below you’ll find two ideas through which I believe an application of data science can markedly improve an existing industry. The first idea, ScalpPlaza, aims to utilize machine learning and advanced market-making trading techniques to revolutionize the secondhand ticket marketplace. The second idea, ReLux, aspires to optimize micro-apartment building layouts in order to provide a modern, luxurious, community-driven, and economically-feasible alternative to city dwellers. While I find both ideas promising I think ScalpPlaza would be easier to implement and has more potential to scale, as I explain in the short video below. Figure .: Meet ScalpPlaza Abstract: ScalpPlaza While recent history has seen financial marketplaces turned upside-down by artificial intelligence and automation, the secondary ticket marketplace has remained remarkably stagnant. As a result of this lack of innovation, one’s options for buying or selling last minute event tickets remain to be exhausting, prone to fraud, and/or costly. ScalpPlaza seeks to provide users with efficient, two-sided ticket marketplaces for any and all live entertainment events. Unlike most incumbent online ticket exchanges, ScalpPlaza will display both the best bid and and the best offer price for any given ticket. This will allow users to buy or sell tickets in seconds when they’re in a rush or to try “cutting the market” in hopes of getting a better deal when they can afford to be patient. ScalpPlaza’s primary differentiating factor, however, is its ability and willingness to provide market liquidity by transacting with its users and accumulating ticket positions. This will be made possible through the use of a data-driven algorithmic ticket-pricing model. Essentially, ScalpPlaza aims to utilize historical data, market trends, and machine learning predict what a ticket is worth on the open market based on the event’s original ticket price and a multitude of other pertinent intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The model will eventually use this estimated ticket value and a variance metric to generate prices at which ScalpPlaza would be comfortable buying or selling any given ticket. These prices will then drift dynamically based on informational changes, order flow, and ScalpPlaza’s internal ticket inventory. This second revenue stream will allow ScalpPlaza to charge signicantly lower fees than the exorbitant 20% (10% buyer + 10% seller) charged by some of its competitors. Collecting enough data to accurately predict open market ticket values will not happen overnight; however, the relatively low fees ScalpPlaza is willing to offer should serve to draw more and more visitors to the site, speeding up the data collecting process and ultimately resulting in a sustainable and revolutionary secondary ticket marketplace. Abstract: ReLux Urbanization has resulted in a growing disparity between what people who live in cities want in a residence and what they are able to afford. ReLux aspires to provide a modern, luxurious, community-driven, and economically-feasible option to city dwellers by asking them to trade superfluous apartment space for spacious communal areas and top-of-the-line amenities. ReLux hopes to utilize trenchant analysis of intra- and inter-city occupation distributions, cost of living indices, general geographical dispositions, and potential local competition in order to identify and target its most promising launch locations. Equally important will be customizing and tailoring each building’s communal areas to local lifestyles and preferences. ReLux hopes to gain a thorough understanding of what people in various locations value in their domestic spaces by supplementing traditional polling data with modern data science. Applying regression analysis, clustering, and other machine learning techniques to the troves of publically available housing data (residential layouts, housing prices, renovation details, etc.) should help ReLux better stay abreast of intra-city, inter-city, and nationwide trends. Admittedly, ReLux is not for everybody; but in an age where shared workspaces and tiny homes are all the rage, ReLux is confident in its ability to carve out a new lifestyle niche and ultimately leverage a “less is more” approach in fostering and maintaining successful communities.

As a result of this lack of innovation in the industry, those looking to sell last-minute tickets to live entertainment events continue to have three imperfect options to do so: Journey over to the event venue and try to sell them the old fashioned way. This involves either trying to be louder and more aggressive than the traditionally brash and slimy crew of ticket-scalpers already stationed there, or getting lowballed and selling the tickets directly to the same people. Regardless, this is a generally undesirable option and easily the most time- and energy-intensive of the three. List the tickets in the “for sale” section of a classified advertisement website such as Craigslist. These websites, while free to use, are antiquated, largely unregulated, and thus rife with scam artists. Additionally, there is no guarantee a transaction partner will be found. List the tickets on an online ticket exchange such as StubHub or SeatGeek. While relatively painless to use, these sites are known for charging exorbitant fees (StubHub, for example, pockets 20% of every transaction) and significantly cut into sale margins. Again, there is no guarantee a buyer will be found. 1.2 It’s simple: buy low, sell high ScalpPlaza’s goal is to provide users with an efficient, two-sided marketplace for any and all live entertainment events. While most incumbent online ticket exchanges only display the prices at which tickets are offered, ScalpPlaza will display both bids and offers. This will allow users to buy or sell tickets in seconds when they’re in a rush or to try “cutting the market” in hopes of getting a better deal when they can afford to be patient. ScalpPlaza’s primary differentiating factor, however, is its ability and willingness to provide marketplace liquidity by transacting with its users and accumulating temporary ticket positions when the market is illiquid. This will be made possible through the use of a data-driven algorithmic ticket-pricing model. Essentially, ScalpPlaza aims to utilize historical data, market trends, and machine-learning in order to best predict what a ticket is worth on the open market based on the event’s original ticket price and a multitude of other pertinent intrinsic (performer(s), location, venue, date, social media #buzz, etc) and extrinsic (expected weather, other happenings in the area, etc) factors. The model will eventually pair this estimated ticket value with a confidence interval to generate prices at which ScalpPlaza would feel comfortable buying or selling any given ticket. These prices will then drift dynamically based on informational changes, order flow, and ScalpPlaza’s internal ticket inventory. While the model’s confidence intervals will inevitably be relatively large on Day 1, more data will lead to less variance and in turn smaller intervals down the line. For example, say a certain 2018 Lady Gaga concert ticket has an estimated market value of $50. ScalpPlaza’s initial bid and offer prices may be $30 and $70, respectively. In other words, ScalpPlaza would be confident in its ability to sell the same ticket for more than $30 or to buy the same ticket for less than $70 between the time of the transaction and the event. By 2019, all else remaining equal, ScalpPlaza may be willing to buy that same Lady Gaga ticket (for a 2019 show) for $40 and sell it for $60 due to increased data in the model’s teaching set and consequently more certainty in its underlying $50 ticket valuation. To help expedite this early data collection process (through ticket transactions), ScalpPlaza will “invest in their own future” by minimizing ticket transaction fees as much as possible while allowing them to stay afloat as a company. Below is an overly simplistic decision tree demonstrating how ScalpPlaza’s dynamic pricing system would work based on the General Admission ticket order flow for that same 2019 Lady Gaga concert: 1.3 Let the machine go to work ScalpPlaza’s ultimate goal is to end the age-old “maximize profit or save energy” debate had by those in the secondhand ticket marketplace by providing them with a tight, two-sided ticket exchange platform. ScalpPlaza’s largest challenge will likely be trying to carve out its own niche in what is already a oversaturated secondhand ticket marketplace, led be the eBay-owned behemoth StubHub. The concept of “shorting” tickets is another potential issue which will have to be investigated, both legally and logistically, before launching. Like any trading opertion, there is inherent risk involved; there will be times when ScalpPlaza sells tickets for less than they paid for them or pays more for tickets than they collected selling them. However, undue risk can be mitigated via sufficiently wide (95%, for example) confidence intervals in the short-term and sheer volume (more users = more potential buyers/sellers to pair) in the long-term. Trying to wedge ScalpPlaza’s foot in the door will be an arduous process but if it can succeed in attracting even a small base of regular users, a steep growth curve should ensue as its machine-learning algorithm goes to work. The more ticket transactions that go through ScalpPlaza, the more data it acquires, the smarter its algorithm becomes, and the tighter ticket markets its willing to offer become. The tighter the markets, the more likely customers are to return for their next secondary ticket transaction. Increased customer traffic leads to even more troves of data being fed into ScalpPlaza’s machine-learning algorithm, and the cycle starts over. While data represent the grease that makes the ScalpPlaza wheels turn, the end result is a sustainable and revolutionary new marketplace which can leverage its multiple revenue streams in order to charge its customers significantly lower fees than its competitors.

["Rearranged-Luxury.html", "2 ReLux: Pay for community and amenities, not superfluous apartment space 2.1 Smaller apartments, bigger lifestyles. 2.2 Regress for progress. 2.3 A new niche niche.", " 2 ReLux: Pay for community and amenities, not superfluous apartment space Keywords luxury, amenities, city living, apartments, microunits, regression analysis, polling, clustering, machine learning 2.1 Smaller apartments, bigger lifestyles. The last two centuries have seen a steady increase in the proportion of Americans living in the country’s cities. After hovering around 5% during America’s incipient days as a rural, agricultural nation, this number has recently climbed north of 82%. Given this trend of urbanization, the finite amount of city space available, and population growth in general, it should come as no surprise that the relative cost of living in a city continues to rise. ReLux hopes to help hopeful city-dwellers combat these rising prices without sacrificing everyday luxuries by offering a new kind of apartment living. ReLux believes that people should pay for comfort and community, not for superfluous apartment space. By limiting the size of its residents’ personal quarters, ReLux will be able to provide top-of-the-line amenities and a collaborative, community-driven environment at a reasonable price. 2.2 Regress for progress. ReLux’s target demographic is anyone and everyone who is fed up with the prices or structure of traditional apartment city living. ReLux is for Dave, a transplant from another city who is looking to meet like-minded individuals and make some potential new friends. ReLux is for Susan, the workaholic who needs a nice, quiet place to sleep but does not want to splurge on a 500 square foot apartment. ReLux is for Betty, the entrepreneur who pays rent to sleep in one place and more rent to work in another. ReLux is for Juan, the commuter who is seeking a bit more intimacy and familiarity than he currently gets out of his traditional weekly hotel stays. ReLux aims to locate the cities where the Daves, Susans, Bettys, and Juans are most prevalent; speaking more generally, preliminary reseach will focus on finding cities with recent influxes of singles and millenials, cities with relatively high numbers of entrepreneurs and freelancers, and cities lacking sufficient residential options for those willing to sacrifice size, but not necessarily luxury, for price. This information can then be used in conjunction with further analysis of occupation distribution, cost of living indices, general geographical dispositions, and potential competition in order to determine ReLux’s most promising launch options. Apartment sizes will vary both within and between locations but the norm will be a space of roughly 60 square feet per person. Conversely, common areas will be spacious, plenty, and multi-functional. One of the keys to ReLux’s success will be accommodating and adapting to the constantly changing needs and desires of society. ReLux hopes to gain a thorough understanding of what people in various locations value in their domestic spaces by supplementing traditional polling data with modern data science. Applying regression analysis, clustering, and other machine learning techniques to the troves of publically available housing data (residential layouts, housing prices, renovation details, etc.) should help ReLux better stay abreast of intra-city, inter-city, and nationwide trends. For example, would potential inhabitants in San Francisco’s Mission District tend to prefer extra offices or additional space to hang out and socialize? Would those in Manhattan feel similarly or would they instead prefer a larger gym? Lifestyle trends will also be accounted for in ReLux’s layout-optimization model; kitchen space, for example, is likely to be a particular area of interest over the next few years given the growing meal kit industry’s potential to spark a resurgence in home cooking. While each building’s initial layout will be important, equally as vital will be continued research and maintaining an active dialogue with inhabitants in order to properly assess if and when changing societal needs justify investing time and money on a communal area remodel. 2.3 A new niche niche. While the continued urbanization of America is often hailed as a sign of progress and prosperity, one undeniably adverse side effect is a growing disparity between what city dwellers want in a home and what they are able to afford. ReLux aspires to provide a modern, luxurious, community-driven, and economically-feasible option to those looking to live downtown. The sheer magnitude of what Relux hopes to do, both literally and figuratively, provides a couple of foreseeable barriers to implementation. The first is the significant initial investment required in purchasing any sort of property. Moreover, that investment is subject to sometimes unpredictable fluctuations in housing prices, which can be a tough pill for some risk-adverse investors to swallow. One option which could be exercised to bypass these concerns altogether would be for ReLux to partner with a construction and development company until it can get its feet off the ground. Although doing so would cut into its profit potential, it would turn a potential rival into a teammate, drastically reducing ReLux’s downside risk in the process. Pairing with a construction and development company would also allow ReLux to focus the entirety of its resources on locating its most potentially fruitful expansion cities and layout-optimization within those cities. Another possible hindrance could stem from asking people to break with the status quo and welcome a new style of living. Admittedly, ReLux is not for everybody; but in an age where shared workspaces and tiny homes are all the rage, ReLux is confident in its ability to carve out a new lifestyle niche and ultimately leverage a “less is more” approach in fostering and maintaining successful communities.
