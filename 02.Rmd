## A beginning.

The last two centuries have seen a steady increase in the proportion of Americans living in the country’s cities. After hovering around 5% during America’s incipient days as a rural, agricultural nation, this number has recently grown north of 82%. Given this trend of urbanization, the finite amount of city space available, and population growth in general, it should come as no surprise that the relative cost of living in a city continues to rise. ReLux hopes to help hopeful city-dwellers combat these rising prices without sacrificing everyday luxuries by offering a new kind of apartment living. ReLux believes that people should pay for comfort and community, not for superfluous apartment space. By limiting the size of its residents’ personal quarters, ReLux is able to provide top-of-the-line-amenities and a collaborative, community-driven environment at a reasonable price.

## A middle.

Apartment sizes will vary both within and between locations but the norm will be a space of roughly 70 square feet per person. Conversely, common areas will be spacious, plenty, and capable of tailoring to every need. One of ReLux’s primary areas of research is focused on optimizing building layouts from city to city. For example, would potential inhabitants in San Francisco tend to prefer a couple of extra offices or additional room to hang out? Would potential inhabitants in New York feel similarly or would they instead prefer a larger kitchen? Through extensive polling and regressive analysis of residential layouts, housing prices, and housing trends, ReLux hopes to gain a better understanding of what people in various cities value in their domestic spaces. ReLux's target demographic is anyone and everyone who is fed up with the prices or structure of traditional apartment living. ReLux is for Dave, a transplant from another city who is looking to meet like-minded individuals and make some potential new friends. ReLux is for Susan, the workaholic who needs a nice, quiet place to sleep but does not want to splurge on a 600 square foot apartment. ReLux is for Betty, the entrepreneur who currently pays rent to sleep in one place only to pay more rent to work in another. ReLux is for Juan, the commuter who is seeking a bit more intimacy and familiarity than he gets out of his traditional weekly hotel stays. ReLux aims to locate the cities where the Daves, the Susans, the Bettys, and the Juans are most prevalent; this information can then be used in conjunction with further analysis of occupation distribution, cost of living indices, general geographical dispositions, and potential competition in order to determine its most promising expansion cities. 

## An end.

While the continued urbanization of America is sometimes hailed as a sign of progress and prosperity, one undeniably adverse side effect is a growing disparity between what city dwellers want in a home and what they are able to afford in a home. ReLux aims to provide a luxurious, community-driven, and economically-feasible option to those looking to live in a city. The sheer magnitude of what Relux hopes to do, both literally and figuratively, provides a couple of potential barriers to implementation. The first is the massive initial investment required in purchasing any sort of city property. Moreover, that initial investment is subject to unpredictable fluctuations in housing prices. Another potential hindrance comes from asking people to break with the status quo and welcome a new style of living. Admittedly, ReLux is not for everybody; but in an age where [shared workspaces](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2017/07/10/wework-hits-20-billion-valuation-in-new-funding-round/#72ef29de1194) and [tiny homes](http://www.countryliving.com/home-design/g1887/tiny-house/?) are all the rage, ReLux is confident in its ability to carve out a new lifestyle niche and ultimately create and foster successul communities.
