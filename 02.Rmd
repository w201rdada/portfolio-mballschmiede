## Smaller apartments, bigger lifestyles.

The last two centuries have seen a steady increase in the proportion of Americans living in the country’s cities. After hovering around 5% during America’s incipient days as a rural, agricultural nation, this number has recently climbed north of 82%. Given this trend of urbanization, the finite amount of city space available, and population growth in general, it should come as no surprise that the relative cost of living in a city continues to rise. ReLux hopes to help hopeful city-dwellers combat these rising prices without sacrificing everyday luxuries by offering a new kind of apartment living. ReLux believes that people should pay for comfort and community, not for superfluous apartment space. By limiting the size of its residents’ personal quarters, ReLux is able to provide top-of-the-line-amenities and a collaborative, community-driven environment at a reasonable price.

## Regress for progress.

Apartment sizes will vary both within and between locations but the norm will be a space of roughly 60 square feet per person. Conversely, common areas will be spacious, plenty, and multi-functional. One of Relux's keys to success will be providing for and adapting to the constantly changing needs and desires of its potential inhabitants. ReLux hopes to gain a better understanding of what people in various cities value in their domestic spaces by supplementing an active dialogue with current inhabitants and traditional polls with modern data science techniques. Using regression analysis, clustering, and other machine learning techniques on the troves of publically available residential layout and housing price data will 

be better suited to stay abreast of intra-city, inter-city, and nationwide housing and lifestyle trends in order to better tailor to its residents needs.

Through extensive polling and regressive analysis of residential layouts, housing prices, and housing trends, ReLux hopes to gain a better understanding of what people in various cities value in their domestic spaces. 

capable of tailoring to every need

One of ReLux’s primary areas of research is focused on optimizing building layouts from city to city. 

For example, would potential inhabitants in San Francisco tend to prefer extra offices or additional room to hang out? Would New Yorkers feel similarly or would they instead prefer a larger kitchen? 

ReLux's target demographic is anyone and everyone who is fed up with the prices or structure of traditional apartment living. ReLux is for Dave, a transplant from another city who is looking to meet like-minded individuals and make some potential new friends. ReLux is for Susan, the workaholic who needs a nice, quiet place to sleep but does not want to splurge on a 600 square foot apartment. ReLux is for Betty, the entrepreneur who currently pays rent to sleep in one place and more rent to work in another. ReLux is for Juan, the commuter who is seeking a bit more intimacy and familiarity than he gets out of his traditional weekly hotel stays. ReLux aims to locate the cities where the Daves, Susans, Bettys, and Juans are most prevalent; this information can then be used in conjunction with further analysis of occupation distribution, cost of living indices, general geographical dispositions, and potential competition in order to determine its most promising expansion options. 

## Never settle.

While the continued urbanization of America is sometimes hailed as a sign of progress and prosperity, one undeniably adverse side effect is a growing disparity between what city dwellers want in a home and what they are able to afford. ReLux aspires to provide a modern, luxurious, community-driven, and economically-feasible option to those looking to live in a city. The sheer magnitude of what Relux hopes to do, both literally and figuratively, provides a couple of potential barriers to implementation. The first is the significant initial investment required in purchasing any sort of city property. Moreover, that initial investment is subject to sometimes unpredictable fluctuations in housing prices, which can be a tough pill for some risk-adverse investors to swallow. Another potential hindrance comes from asking people to break with the status quo and welcome a new style of living. Admittedly, ReLux is not for everybody; but in an age where [shared workspaces](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/wework-valuation-analysis/) and [tiny homes](http://www.countryliving.com/home-design/g1887/tiny-house/?) are all the rage, ReLux is confident in its ability to carve out a new lifestyle niche and ultimately leverage a "less is more" approach in fostering and maintaining successful communites.
