## Smaller apartments, bigger lifestyles.

The last two centuries have seen a steady increase in the proportion of Americans living in the country’s cities. After hovering around 5% during America’s incipient days as a rural, agricultural nation, this number has recently climbed north of 82%. Given this trend of urbanization, the finite amount of city space available, and population growth in general, it should come as no surprise that the relative cost of living in a city continues to rise. ReLux hopes to help hopeful city-dwellers combat these rising prices without sacrificing everyday luxuries by offering a new kind of apartment living. ReLux believes that people should pay for comfort and community, not for superfluous apartment space. By limiting the size of its residents’ personal quarters, ReLux is able to provide top-of-the-line-amenities and a collaborative, community-driven environment at a reasonable price.

## Regress for progress.

ReLux's target demographic is anyone and everyone who is fed up with the prices or structure of traditional apartment city living. ReLux is for Dave, a transplant from another city who is looking to meet like-minded individuals and make some potential new friends. ReLux is for Susan, the workaholic who needs a nice, quiet place to sleep but does not want to splurge on a 500 square foot apartment. ReLux is for Betty, the entrepreneur who currently pays rent to sleep in one place and more rent to work in another. ReLux is for Juan, the commuter who is seeking a bit more intimacy and familiarity than he gets out of his traditional weekly hotel stays. ReLux aims to locate the cities where the Daves, Susans, Bettys, and Juans are most prevalent; this information can then be used in conjunction with further analysis of occupation distribution, cost of living indices, general geographical dispositions, and potential competition in order to determine its most promising expansion options. 

Apartment sizes will vary both within and between locations but the norm will be a space of roughly 60 square feet per person. Conversely, common areas will be spacious, plenty, and multi-functional. One of the keys to ReLux's success will be accomodating and adapting to the constantly changing needs and desires of society. ReLux hopes to gain a thorough understanding of what people in various cities value in their domestic spaces by supplementing traditional polling data and an active dialogue with prospective inhabitants with modern data science. Applying regression analysis, clustering, and other machine learning techniques to the troves of publically available housing data (residential layouts, housing prices, renovation details, etc.) should help ReLux better stay abreast of intra-city, inter-city, and nationwide trends. For example, would potential inhabitants in San Francisco's Mission District tend to prefer extra offices or additional space to hang out and socialize? Would those in Manhattan feel similarly or would they instead prefer a larger gym? Lifestyle trends will also be considered in ReLux's layout-optimization model; for example, kitchen space is likely to be a particular area of interest over the next few years as the growing meal kit industry has the potential to spark a resurgence in home cooking. 

## A new niche niche.

While the continued urbanization of America is sometimes hailed as a sign of progress and prosperity, one undeniably adverse side effect is a growing disparity between what city dwellers want in a home and what they are able to afford. ReLux aspires to provide a modern, luxurious, community-driven, and economically-feasible option to those looking to live in a city. The sheer magnitude of what Relux hopes to do, both literally and figuratively, provides a couple of possible barriers to implementation. The first is the significant initial investment required in purchasing any sort of city property. Moreover, that initial investment is subject to sometimes unpredictable fluctuations in housing prices, which can be a tough pill for risk-adverse investors to swallow. One option which could be exercised to bypass these concerns altogether would be to partner with a construction/development company. Although doing so would cut into ReLux's profit potential, it would also serve to turn a potential rival into a teammate, drastically reducing ReLux's downside while allowing it to narrow its focus to building and location optimization in the process. Another hindrance could stem from asking people to break with the status quo and welcome a new style of living. Admittedly, ReLux is not for everybody; but in an age where [shared workspaces](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/wework-valuation-analysis/) and [tiny homes](http://www.countryliving.com/home-design/g1887/tiny-house/?) are all the rage, ReLux is confident in its ability to carve out a new lifestyle niche and ultimately leverage a "less is more" approach in fostering and maintaining successful communities.
